# O.S.E.N Web-Backend

- Serve Log
  - We log which files get served to which IP's
- Rust-based

This simple Rust-based Web backend runs the O.S.E.N Webpage
and does not connect to any other O.S.E.N services
or store/use any user data.

## Running yourself

- Move into directory
- Use 'Cargo run' to run the backend directly
- Use 'Cargo build' to build it for usage after

That's it, it just works :)
